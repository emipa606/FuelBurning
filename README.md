# Description

1, Three types of fuel burning traps are added in the security category.
2, They ignite with impact. For example, shoot, beat, and of course blow up.
3, Be careful not to burn your colony.

If you attack the fuel directly or shoot a gun nearby, heat accumulates in the fuel. It ignites when its heat exceeds a certain amount.
It is difficult to ignite the fuel (concentrated) that has large heat capacity by impact so you should use the fuel (diluted) and fuel(nomal) as a fuse.

As you may know, the easiest way is to throw a Molotov.
